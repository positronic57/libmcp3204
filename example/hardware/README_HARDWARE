AnalogTemperatureSensor module demonstrates the measurement of temperature using analog temperature sensor TMP36 on
RaspberryPi over SPI. The same circuit can be use with other embedded systems or directly connected to any 
microcontroller that support SPI and 3.3V power supply.

The analog signal from the TMP36 goes first through low pass RC filter in front of voltage follower based on
Microchip MCP601 single supply operational amplifier. The output from the operational amplifier feeds the 
first input channel of the MCP3204 12-bit SPI analog to digital convertor. Raspberry Pi reads the digitized value 
of the signal from MCP304 over SPI. 

The reference signal for the ADC is provided by a dedicated reference voltage
REF02.

The PIN layout (from left to right) of J1 connector from the circuit is:

	+5V  - power supply voltage for REF02
	+3V3 - main power supply voltage for the rest of the elements 
	/CS  - SPI chip select signal for MCP3204
	CLK  - SPI clock signal of MCP3204
	DIN  - SPI MOSI pin of MCP3204
	DO   - SPI MISO pin of MCP3204
	GND  - ground

Connecting the module to the Raspberry Pi model B revision 1 of the board
