This program demonstrates the usage of libmcp3204 library on Raspberry Pi.
An analog signal generated by TMP36 temperature sensor is converted by the MCP3204 to a digital value
that is transferred to Raspberry Pi for calculating the actual temperature value. The communication
between the MCP3204 ADC and Raspberry Pi is done by the libmcp3204 library.


Software and hardware prerequisits

The libmcp3204 library must be installed before compiling this program.
The library depends on the spi_bcm2708 kernel module. Load the module before executing the 
program.
Additional hardware components like TMP36 sensor, MCP3204 etc. must be connected to the 
Raspberry Pi prior the execution. The electrical schema of the hardware module for
temperature management together with the PCB layout 
can be found in the "hardware" folder. They are part of Fritzing 
(http://fritzing.org) project file.


Compiling the source code

To make the executable with:

	#gcc -o libmcp3204_example libmcp3204_example.c -lmcp3204

Samle output from the program after execution:

	#sudo ./libmcp3204_example
	Digital value of the sensor reading: 1244
	Analog value: 0.7565V
	Temperature t=25.65C

WARNING:

The code is tested on Raspberry Pi Model B Revision 1 board with latest version of Rasbian Linux.
Before use, always check the GPIO and SPI manuals for your Raspberry Pi board to take possible 
hardware changes on Pi board in consideration.

The source and the hardware module for temperature measurement are provided as it is without any warranty. 
Use it on your own risk!
The author does not take any responsibility for the damage caused while using this software 
or the hardware module.
