Installation manual


1. Building the library

Navigate to the library source directory and execute:

        #make


2. Installing the library

In the same directory execute the following command:

        #sudo make install

By default the library is installed in /usr/lib folder. The corresponding header file is placed
in /usr/include folder. Those locations are predefined by the $PREFIX variable in the Makefile.
For installing the library in a location different than the default one, set the $PREFIX variable
to desired value.

After successful installation, refresh the list of available libraries:

        #sudo ldconfig

To remove the files created in the source directory during the building process use:

        #make clean       


3. Remove/Uninstalling the library

        #sudo make uninstall

This will delete the .so file and the header file form the installation folders.
